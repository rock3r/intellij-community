/**
 * One shortcut-dispatch host per Compose surface (a standalone window, or a bridge panel).
 *
 * Install [resolverRootModifier] at the surface's content root, then:
 * - standalone: pass [onPreviewKeyEvent] to the `Window(onPreviewKeyEvent = …)` parameter. That hook runs before scene
 *   dispatch and sees KEY_TYPED events, which is required for typed suppression — a root `Modifier.onPreviewKeyEvent`
 *   sees no typed events and cannot prevent a claimed printable key from inserting its character.
 * - IJPL bridge: the panel wrapper consults [claimsKeyDown] from `KeyboardAwareFocusOwnerProvider` to skip
 *   `IdeKeyEventDispatcher` for claimed strokes; commands stay with the IJPL keymap. Compose popups/dialogs run in
 *   their own scene layers with separate key handling: Jewel-owned popups must thread [onPreviewKeyEvent] into their
 *   `Popup(onPreviewKeyEvent = …)` for dispatch to work while they are open.
 *
 * **Threading:** dispatch is UI-thread-synchronous — [onPreviewKeyEvent], [claimsKeyDown], and [runResolvedInvocation]
 * must run on the surface's UI thread (the AWT event dispatch thread in production), and the bound handlers they invoke
 * run there too. Violations are logged as errors, or thrown when [org.jetbrains.jewel.foundation.JewelFlags.strictMode]
 * is enabled. Presentation sampling is different: [presentationFor] and [presentations] read an atomically published
 * snapshot of the focused bindings that may be up to one UI frame stale. That snapshot read is thread-safe, but whether
 * sampling as a whole is depends on the backing: with the IJPL bridge backing it is safe from any thread (the bridge
 * samples from background action updates and reads the platform data context); with the standalone default backing,
 * resolving a binding that computes its presentation from the focused Compose tree must run on the surface's UI thread.
