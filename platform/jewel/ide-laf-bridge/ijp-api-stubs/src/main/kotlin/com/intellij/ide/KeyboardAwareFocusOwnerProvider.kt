/**
 * Compile-only stub of the platform interface introduced with IJPL-212347.
 *
 * The bridge sources reference the real interface, which the released IntelliJ Platform artifacts this
 * Gradle build compiles against do not contain yet. This stub is on the compile classpath only — it is
 * never packaged into any Jewel artifact, and at runtime the platform's own class is the one loaded.
 *
 * Delete this directory (and its wiring in `ide-laf-bridge/build.gradle.kts`) as soon as
 * `libs.versions.toml`'s `idea` version points at a build that ships
 * `com.intellij.ide.KeyboardAwareFocusOwnerProvider`.
